# ImageClassification

A simple implementation of multi-stage image classification using support vector machine (SVM). Further classification using Feature Vector and Softmax score

## Getting Started

Libraries include ````numpy, pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib````

1. This repository only contains the final stage of a multi-stage classification, which is classification using SVM by Softmax and Feature Vector

2. Initial training checkpoint model and image files are not included

3. Tested on Tensorflow 1.13.
